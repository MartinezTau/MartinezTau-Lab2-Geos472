# ReadMe for my exploratory Lab 2 - Mapping driving routes to hospitals from UBC

Link to my map: https://martineztau.github.io/MartinezTau-Lab2-Geos472/hospitals.html

In making this interactive map, I attempeted to aim it both UBC students specifically, as well as the broader population in general, with the main purpose of this map being directions and providing the fastest driving routes to local hospitals across Metro Vancouver. Focused around access to medical care, this maps aims to help those looking for alternatives to the UBC hospital, due to wait times or perhaps due to off hours. I designed the map to be simple, yet easy to follow, following a similart design and layout to popular maps such as Google and Maps, while providing easy pop-up and mouse-over information regaring the addresses of hospitals and their respective cities. 

By incorperating interactive elements provided by mapbox.jl, such as mouse-over information while hovering over an icon, custom icons, as well as the interactive direction mapping to the point of your choice on the map, allows the user to quickly and easy access the primary information from this map. Futhermore, the included street based navigation base map and zooming features, would allow the user to better navigate and understand the area they would be traveling through.

Where this map has alot of room to improve on, is further focusing on the code associated with the mapping directions. While I wasn't able to fuigure it out on my own, addapting the code to where the user can input their address as the start point, as well as automatically map the shortest distance to the nearest hospital, would allow for a much better intereactive and information focused experience, providing even more insight into the data.
